# Description
This program presents convolutional kernel density estimation, a method used to detect intercritical epilpetic spikes (IEDs) in [Gardy et al., 2019].

The user provides a time series as input. The algorithm will perform the following steps:
- Transform the timeseries into an image
- Convolve this image

The user can then apply filters, like a low-pass filter, to isolate low density events, such as IEDs.

Please, open _**`main.py`**_ and change the path inside to use the program.

# Procedure example (main.py)
```
### Init parameters (root is the path to the folder you have downloaded)
root = r"~/CKDE"
event_num = 5

### Get a timeseries filepath (look in the folder you have downloaded)
timeseries_folderpath =  os.path.join(root, "test_events_database\events_signal_data")
timeserie_filename = f"event_{event_num}.txt"

### Load a timeseries from the sample data provided with this program (1D)
signal = load_timeseries(timeseries_folderpath, timeserie_filename) # or,
#signal = random_signal_simulation()

### Get the timeseries info
json_dict = json.load(open(os.path.join(root,"test_events_database\events_info.json")))
sfreq = json_dict["events_info"][event_num]["sampling_frequency"]

### Convert it to a 2D signal
image_2D = from_1D_to_2D(signal, bandwidth = 1)

### Convolve the 2D signal
image_2D_convolved = convolve_2D_image(image_2D, convolution = "gaussian custom")

### Plot result
fig_name = "Epileptic spike (signal duration: 400 ms) \n\n[1] raw [2] imaged [3] convoluted"
pot_result(signal, image_2D, image_2D_convolved, fig_name)
```

# Some information about the dataset
We propose some simulated data to validate our procedure with a known frequency, duration and position. This database is structured as shown in figure 1. User can either use these data, use his own, or simulate some. A signal simulation function is also provided in the program.

# Methods
Figure 2 shows how the convolved image (2D) is drawn from the raw signal (1D). A: Convolution process. B: Full process.

# Results
Figure 3 shows the result of the full process. The timeseries used as input is an IED called "event_5" in the data sample we provide with this program.
